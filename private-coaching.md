### A coaching relationship serves as the foundation for change. None of us can change alone.

#### 1:1 Private Coaching

Sooner or later life presents us with events or circumstances that require us to re-examine who we are, what we're doing, and why. Our responses to these questions determine how fulfilled we will feel and whether we will be able to make a unique contribution to the world. Coaching serves as a support system for engaging in a more authentic and effective way of being. Through meaningful conversation, reflection, and assigned practices, I help individuals move past problems and perceptions that hinder them from accessing their own unique wisdom.
