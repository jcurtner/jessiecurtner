### A coaching relationship serves as the foundation for change.

#### 1:1 Individual Coaching

Sooner or later life presents us with events or circumstances that require us to re-examine who we are, what we're doing, and why. Our responses to these questions determine how fulfilled we will feel and whether we will be able to make a unique contribution to the world. Coaching serves as a support system for engaging in a more authentic and effective way of being. Through meaningful conversation, reflection, and assigned practices, I help individuals move past problems and perceptions that hinder them from accessing their own unique wisdom.

#### Small Group Coaching

Showing up authentically in a group is challenging. Many of us feel the need to impress, be liked, or perhaps shy away from the spotlight. Group coaching is a wonderful way to explore your own unique self expression in a safe environment of self exploration. As the facilitator, I'll provide short meditations, journaling prompts, and creative exercises to help the group discover deeper parts of themselves and each other. Being really seen for who you are in a group setting is a powerful and healing experience.
