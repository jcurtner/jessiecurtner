### Getting stuck forces us to find creative solutions for getting unstuck.

#### What is Coaching?

The truth is that we all get stuck, lost, disengaged, and even depressed from time to time. It's part of life. And believe it or not, it's a great part of life because it forces us to rethink the way we've been doing things. When we become more aware of our current habits, it is easier to adopt new habits. Integral coaching offers support and guidance when you've decided that it's time to set out on a new path, but you're not sure how to take the first few steps. 

Whether you're an [individual](/individuals) looking for support in navigating personal issues, or a [company](/companies) looking for programs that will make your office come alive, my coaching programs can help. My programs are tailored to each person, or group, in order to create change that is lasting and meaningful.

## Testimonials

##### Dre Kernodle, San Francisco CA

"Before coming to Jessie, I felt anxious and unsure about what I wanted in my life. I've been seeing Jessie for almost a year now, and I have much more clarity and understanding of who I am. This has led to greater confidence and success in both my professional and personal life. I cannot recommend Jessie highly enough as a coach."

##### Caroline Casseli, San Francisco CA

"Since coaching, I've started to integrate more relaxation into my full life - little moments of mindfulness and meditation interspersed throughout the day. Overall I've felt much more focused and calm in the quest to achieve my goals. My work, friendships, and health have all been positively impacted by Jessie's reflective, inspirational, and encouraging presence."
