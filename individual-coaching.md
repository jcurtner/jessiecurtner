# Individual Coaching

### A coaching relationship serves as the foundation for change. None of us can change alone.

Sooner or later life presents us with events or circumstances that require us to reexamine who we are, what we're doing and why. Our responses to these questions determine how fulfilled we will feel and whether we will be able to make a unique contribution to the world. Coaching serves as a support system for engaging in a more authentic and effective way of being. Through meaningful conversation, reflection, and assigned practices, I help individuals move past problems and perceptions that hinder them from accessing their own unique wisdom.
