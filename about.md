### It's the little moments that give life meaning.

#### Background

I believe that life offers us lessons in every moment. How we choose to respond to these lessons dictates the course of our life and the satisfaction we experience along the way. As a certified integral coach, I support clients in becoming the people they most desire to be. When I'm not working with clients, I'm likely to be found on my yoga mat, on a hike with my dog, or on a date with my wonderful life partner. I'm originally from Colorado but have called the Bay Area home for the past 8 years. In short, I truly love the unique experience of living.
