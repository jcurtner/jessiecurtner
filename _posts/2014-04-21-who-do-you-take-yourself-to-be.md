<em>"As I have said, the first thing is to be honest with yourself. You can never have an impact on society if you have not changed yourself… Great peacemakers are all people of integrity, of honesty, but humility." -Nelson Mandela</em>

A couple weeks ago a coach friend of mine asked me, “Who do you take yourself to be?” I had no idea what she was talking about. Her question came in response to a seemingly unrelated issue: I was telling her that there are times when I can feel my intuition strongly and other times when I can’t seem find it. I wanted her help in understanding what internal and external experiences influence my ability to access my intuition. She explained that when what we’re doing things that are not in alignment with how we understand ourselves, it can be hard to access our intuition.

Since our conversation, I’ve been exploring my self image and how it relates to my intuition. One concept that comes to mind around this is “integrity.” It occurred to me that when a person is acting from a place of integrity, intuition flows easier. The definition of integrity is “a state of being whole and undivided.” In order to be “whole and undivided” there are three concepts that need to be in relative alignment:

1. The reality of how we act
2. How we perceive ourselves
3. Who we wish we were

Our relationship to our own life is impossible for us to see completely clearly. All of us wear colored lenses and have blind spots. One exercise that I give my clients to sharpen their perception of reality is to ask their closest friends how they view them. What do our friends think about our general mood, attitude, and actions, and what does that say about us? When our perception of ourselves, or who we wish we were, doesn’t line up with what our friends tell us, it can be painful. But it’s important not to immediately reject what our friends say and instead try to listen and understand.

The next area of integral being is how we perceive ourselves. This is the question that my friend was asking me when she said, “Who do you take yourself to be?” One way to conceptualize this is to identify with a broad archetype. A fun exercise can be to write down all the attributes and virtues that you think define you. Then you can try to come up with an archetype that encompasses what you’ve written down. Archetypes can come from anywhere. It can be a character in a book, an astrological sign, or a more traditional archetype like a healer or wise-man. The idea is to pick a concept that is broad enough to encompass many different ways of being and positive enough that it’s something that creates openings for growth. I’m still working on an archetype that works for me, but it’s been a fun and creative endeavor.

The last domain is how we wish were. This is very closely to related to your archetype. All of us have areas where we can grow. Many of us need to learn how to communicate more affectively, set better boundaries and be more honest with ourselves and others. It’s important to have a concept of self that you can grow into. Identifying with an archetype is a great way to do this. However we must also remain grounded in who we are right now. It’s wonderful to want to be a healer, but if the reality is that you don’t have a practice of caring for yourself or others, that needs to be looked at honestly. In order to grow we first have to understand and accept where there is room for growth. 

This is what integrity is all about. When a person is really integrated, the way they act, the way they perceive themselves and the way they wish they were are all in alignment. For example, if someone sees them self as an artist, the integrated artist would not only think about them self as being filled with creative passion, but would also be actively creating and working towards their most deeply held dreams. We all have moments of this sort of integration. It usually comes when we are doing something that we really truly love. Sometimes this is called “being in flow.” 

When I’m in a situation that honors myself and my dreams, my intuition comes through loud and clear. But when I’m acting in a way that is in conflict to who I am or who I want to be, my intuition goes dormant. For me I have no problem hearing my intuition when I’m in a coaching session, meditating or writing. But sometimes when I’m trying to impress someone or fit in somewhere, my intuition seems to run and hide. This doesn’t mean that we should all stop doing what needs to be done (an artist still has to do their taxes), but it does mean that we need to take time to nurture our dreams, explore our archetypes and begin to integrate all aspects of our lives. When we’re able to do this we not only have intuition on our side, but we’re also in the flow and fulfilling our own unique destiny.
