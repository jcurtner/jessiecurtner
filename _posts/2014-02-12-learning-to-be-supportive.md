Supporting someone you’re close to as they go through something difficult can be tricky. I’ve been navigating these waters myself recently, as several people in my life are facing difficult crossroads. As I’ve tried to be there for them, I’ve  had to look at my own past patterns of support, kick those to the curb, and begin to practice a new way of being there for people. 

In the past, I believed being supportive meant two things: empathy and problem solving. We generally think of empathy as a good thing. After all what can be more loving then experiencing what someone else is feeling as if it were happening to you. However, for many of us, especially those of us prone to extreme sensitivity, empathy can render us unable to see the problem through an outsider’s perspective. We can become so wrapped up in someone else’s situation, that we completely loose our objectivity and clarity.

Which brings me to problem solving. Now it may seem obvious, but trying to solve a problem with limited perspective and an overwhelming amount of emotion is difficult (if not impossible). However that is how many of us attempt to problem solve when we are experiencing a life challenge (or when we’re experiencing someone else’s challenge empathically). I have discovered that my past way of “supporting” has in many cases made my loved ones feel like there was less hope for them. In seeing that I am just as upset as they are, and just as unable to identify possibilities, they begin to perceive their situation as even more hopeless. That’s not a very supportive way of being.

So in an attempt to offer real support, I’ve had to redefine the concept in my own mind. I’ve come up with two new support tools: compassion and what I’m going to call “greenhousing.” There are two definitions of compassion. The first is “sympathetic pity”  and the second is “concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.” It is the second definition that I believe to be helpful.

Genuinely caring for someone’s well being is a wonderful thing. It helps us feel connected to one another and the world at large. We’ve all had experiences where we felt that someone completely understood us and wanted the best for us. Having that sense of “being seen” is often enough to help us begin to identify positive possibilities in our lives. However, sometimes just being compassionate is not enough to truly support someone.

The next step is to create a space in which that person feels not only seen for who they are, but also safe and hopeful. I call it “greenhousing” because that’s the kind of environment you want to create for someone that is hurting. Wouldn’t it be wonderful that if in your presence a person felt that they could, grow, thrive and ultimately become something stronger and more substantial then what they were before. This is what real support feels like. It’s not easy to act as a greenhouse, but I’ve compiled some tips that have helped me start. 

1. Be aware of your own capacity. If you feel yourself taking on the other person’s emotions or anxiety, you probably need to take a break from being their support. 
2. Remind the person you’re supporting of a quality you love about them. This is one of the quickest ways to help someone feel seen. It also has the added bonus of calming down someone’s nervous system. 
3. Don’t get lost in the details of your loved one’s story. Remember that the story they are telling themselves, over and over again, is only one narrow view of the problem. Keep a lookout for possible patterns, old baggage and defeating thoughts. 
4. Talk to them from your heart, not from your brain. Chances are this person has spent hours milling over this problem in their head. Model for them the opportunity to drop down into their heart center. Use language like “I’m sensing,” “I’m getting a feeling,” and “what does it feel like?” A great question is “At the most basic level are you feeling fear, sadness, anger or shame?”
5. Bring them present. You can do this by bringing awareness to the fact that in this very moment they are safe, loved and that you are right there with them. 
6. Avoid any attempt to problem solve. Instead offer broad possibilities of different ways of perceiving the problem. If they don’t want to accept it, drop it and go back to just being there with them. If you push your agenda, you’ll move into trying to problem solve and fix.

As a very sensitive person, I know that sometimes I will still become overly involved in the lives of my loved ones. I will rack my brain for some narrow “fix it” solution and possibly make the situation worse. However if I can remember to be my own support system, and my own greenhouse, I’ll continue to grow and learn. And if I’m really lucky, I’ll help others to do the same.
