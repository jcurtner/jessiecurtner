<em>"Painting completed my life." -Frida Kahlo</em>

All of us want to do work that inspires us, that helps us embody the best of who we are, and that leads us to a place of growth and possibilities. Phrases like “follow your bliss” and “do what you love” have become more and more commonplace. These beautiful directions have many of us reaching for a sense of fulfillment beyond what our current lives are offering. As I’ve seen in my own life, and in the lives of my clients, these lofty ideals sometimes leave us feeling like passion-seeking failures. 

It has come to my awareness that this sense of unattained vocation stems not from these intensions being unrealistic, but rather from jumping in the deep end before we actually know how to swim. What I mean by this is that we need to “find our ourselves” before we can “find our calling.” If you don’t know what you would do if you had a million dollars, I have a passion-project for you: yourself!

I began consciously doing self development work about 5 years ago. I started for the same reason a lot of people do: because I was hurting. I had been through a bad breakup, and my whole world seem to be flipped upside down. Although I wasn’t completely happy in my career, I didn’t start doing yoga, mediation, or journaling to find a different job. I did it because I felt lost. Now I see that in finding myself, I have also begun to find my vocation. The path was long, and certainly not straight, but today I can honestly say that I know exactly what I’d do if I had a million dollars. And, better yet, I’m beginning to do it (even without the funds). 

Reflecting on my own journey of self-discovery, I noticed some pretty clear steps that I’ve outlined below, both as questions and exercises. If some of these steps resonate with you, I’d encourage you to contemplate where you are in your own journey of self-development. Perhaps even crack open a journal. Journaling is a great resource, and a wonderful way to chronicle how far you’ve come. 

Step 1: What do I like and what do I dislike? Sounds simple right? Not necessarily. Many of us have internalized the expectations and tastes of so many others that it’s very hard to differentiate between what we actually like from what we’ve absorbed. Oftentimes we’re even made to feel ashamed of what we like and so we repress that interest. At this level, just become curious about yourself.  What makes you feel good and what doesn’t? A quick way to check in on this is how do you feel after you’ve finished doing what you’re doing. Do you feel like you have more energy or less?

<em>Exercise for Step 1: Pick 10 verbs and write them after the word “I” (for example I am, I want, I should.) in a column down the edge of your paper. Then, without thinking too much, write 10 different adjectives for each verb. Start to notice what comes up. Are the sentences positive or negative? Explore them.</em>

Step 2: What are my values? Again this can be tricky because so many values originate from our family or our culture, which isn’t to say these don’t belong to you, but it’s worth exploring if the they’re the values you want to carry you forward.

<em>Exercise for Step 2: Write 4 columns. In the first column write a general value (such as spirituality, relationships, philanthropy, health, work, sex). In the next columns write out what your parent’s, your culture’s and your own dominant value are for each topic.</em>

Step 3: Who am I with other people? Beginning to notice ourselves in relationships, can be one of the most difficult development processes. It means beginning to see ourselves more honestly and objectively. We all have bad relationship patterns. And we all have blind spots within these patterns. The key at this level feeling secure enough to listen to our loved ones, about our blind spots, without reacting with passive or outward aggression. 

<em>Exercise for Step 3: Have an honest conversation with someone to whom you are close and for whom you have a lot of respect (it’s important that this person is as, or more, self-aware then you are). Ask this person how they view you. Ask for specifics about how they feel when they’re around you, what “role” if any they see you playing, what they love about you, and what patterns they’d like to see you let go of.  Notice your reaction to what they say, without saying anything.</em>

Step 4: Is the life I’m living serving me? At this step “discipline” becomes huge in your life. You begin to realize that in every moment you have a decision on how to act or not act. The more decisions you make that serve your values and best intentions the more you begin to live a life in service of yourself.  Identifying what and who supports you to make good decisions everyday is key to sustaining a pattern of self-development. 

<em>Exercise for Step 4: Create an artistic “tribal” board. Put yourself in the middle of the board, as the chief, and place (in drawings or magazine cutouts) the people (ex: family, friends) and resources (ex: exercise, meditation, painting) around you that support you. This is your tribe and you’re the chief. Think about how you can make more space for what is on your board and how you can be a better chief.</em>

The search for self is one that is always evolving and never-ending. These steps only scratch the service of what is available to explore. My only hope is that they inspire you to start your own journey of self-discovery. And remember to have fun along the way! As you search for more meaning in your life, don’t forget to laugh at your shortcomings and celebrate your moments of clarity. Hopefully one day you’ll wake up and think “someone give me a million dollars because I know EXACTLY what I want to do with it!!”
