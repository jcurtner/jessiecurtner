I’ve noticed that many partnered people (me included) tend to care about their significant other’s behavior very personally. This caring can range from genuine concern to petty griping, but the underlying motive seems to be the same. We feel that the attitudes, actions, words and beliefs of our partner have a profound effect on our lives, so much so that not reacting (passively or aggressively) to our perception of what is “wrong” with them feels like an injustice to ourselves. 

This pattern recently came to my attention when I was trying to change my boyfriend’s perception of a difficulty he was having at work. He didn’t see it my way, and suddenly I felt a righteous need to make him do so. Long story short, we got into a fight.  Later I began to wonder why I cared so much about Kyle’s problem that didn’t even involve me. And it occurred to me that I had begun to treat my boyfriend with the same sort of short-sighted attitude I often treat myself. I had lost my ability to see his separateness. 

In psychology they refer to this type of behavior as being enmeshed or co-dependent. But I have come to understand this as simply a missed opportunity to see someone I love in their own authentic, beautifully-flawed wholeness. Viewing ourselves with this kind of broad lens is almost impossible. Regardless of how self-aware or spiritually connected we are, sometimes we loose sight of the the fact that everyday we’re changing, growing and learning. We forget that the journey we’re on is a very unique little part of something much bigger. Every obstacle we face in our lives is a specially gifted opportunity to have a new insight about ourselves and our shared world.

It would be a beautiful thing if in the midst of sadness, boredom, pain or anger we were able to internalize that our current uncomfortable state is exactly where we’re supposed to be. And instead of reacting or avoiding, we simply began to look for the lesson. Most of us aren’t able to do that all time. However, as human beings we have ample opportunity to practice this with the people around us. I now see and honor the fact that Kyle is on a sacred journey much different then my own. His obstacles, and subsequent insights, will come at the right time for him, not me. And it’s awesome to watch! It’s like having front-row seats to the most interesting play on earth.

When I’m able to observe Kyle’s life with an objective lovingness, I start to get a taste of what it might be like if I were able to do that for myself. I now trust Kyle and the universe enough to support his journey instead of trying to steer it in the direction of my choosing. And I’ve come to see that it is just as important to honor our separateness, as it is to honor our connection.
