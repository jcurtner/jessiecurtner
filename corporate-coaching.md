# Corporate Coaching

### The time we spend at work is just as valuable as the time we spend outside of work.

#### 1:1 Corporate Coaching

Sometimes, a professional is faced with circumstances that require them to re-examine who they are, what they are doing, and why. Maybe there is something going on at home that makes it difficult for them to focus, maybe they have been presented with a new boss or manager with whom they don't get along, or maybe their communication style is negatively affecting those around them. These issues can be tricky to navigate at work, where there is limited opportunity for self-reflection. Without the right support, an employee can become more and more discouraged and disengaged. With 1:1 coaching, employees build the skills and the capacity they need in order to be productive, affective and joyful!

#### Corporate Mindfulness Programs

Mindfulness is defined as the intentional, accepting and non-judgmental focus of one's attention on the present moment. When practiced consistently, mindfulness enhances ones ability to focus, listen, create and be satisfied. With such wonderful benefits it's easy to see why more and more companies are adopting mindfulness programs and practices in the office. I can help companies implement mindfulness programs, lead meditation groups, and create an office of Zen! One way to get started is to invite me to host a weekly mindfulness morning. During these 1-hour sessions I'll lead a 20 minute meditation and host a conversation about mindfulness in the workplace. 

#### Leadership Groups

A leader does not become a leader in a silo. Leadership is about effectively relating to others. In my leadership groups I'll create a safe environment for a group of employees (4-10) to explore their unique gifts, their personal voice, their innate power, as well as what is getting in their way from becoming the person they most desire to be. Being "seen" in a group setting is a powerful experience, one that prepares individuals for the art of leading. After 6 months of weekly or bi-weekly meetings, employees will be able to more easily connect with others and with themselves.
